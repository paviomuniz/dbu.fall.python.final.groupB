Project Proposal: Fake vs Real News Classifier

Project Overview:
The project is aim to develop a text classification model using natural language processing (NLP) to distinguish between fake and real news articles.
This model will be trained on a labeled dataset containing real and fake news articles.
The textual data will be transformed into numerical features suitable for machine learning algorithms.
